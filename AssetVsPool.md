Ah, this is a common question when modeling blockchain events in a data platform like FireFly or a ledger system. The reason for linking a **pool to an asset** even when there is already a pool is about **logical separation and data modeling best practices**:

---

### 1. **Pools represent collections, not assets themselves**

* A **pool** is usually a smart contract that can hold tokens (or other items) and track activities, transfers, or events.
* But a pool does **not inherently define the type of asset it contains**—it’s just a container.
* By creating a separate **asset entity**, you can:

  * Track all pools holding the same asset.
  * Store asset-specific metadata (like name, symbol, decimals, total supply) independently of any single pool.

---

### 2. **Enables flexible reporting and analytics**

* Linking pools to assets allows queries like:

  * *“Show total token balance across all pools of this asset.”*
  * *“List all pools that have interacted with this asset.”*
* Without this separation, every report would have to dig into pool addresses and infer the asset type from the pool, which is messy.

---

### 3. **Supports multi-pool or multi-contract scenarios**

* Some assets may exist across multiple pools or smart contracts:

  * Example: USDC can exist in multiple DeFi pools (Compound, Aave, etc.).
* Having a **single asset entity** lets all these pools reference the same asset, avoiding duplication and making aggregation easier.

---

### 4. **Data model consistency**

* In systems like FireFly, the **asset → pool → transfer** hierarchy is standard:

  ```
  Asset
    └─ Pool
        └─ Transfer
            └─ Event
  ```
* This makes the relationships explicit and consistent, which simplifies:

  * Data ingestion
  * Event tracking
  * Auditing

---

✅ **TL;DR:** Even though the pool “contains” the tokens, linking it to an asset separates the **concept of what the tokens are** from **where they are held**, enabling aggregation, metadata storage, and cleaner relationships.

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram showing Asset → Pool → Transfer → Event**, which makes this structure super clear visually. Do you want me to do that?
