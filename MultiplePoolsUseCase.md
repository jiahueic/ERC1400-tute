Exactly! Multiple pools can exist for the **same token** for a few common reasons in blockchain and DeFi systems:

---

### 1. **Different smart contracts for different purposes**

* Each pool is usually a **separate smart contract** managing the same token but in a different context.
* Examples:

  * **Liquidity pools** on different DEXes (Uniswap Pool A vs Pool B) both contain USDC.
  * **Staking or yield farming pools** for the same token but with different reward rules.
* Each pool may track deposits, withdrawals, or rewards independently.

---

### 2. **Segregation of participants**

* Pools can isolate certain users or groups.

  * Example: private staking pools for large investors vs public pools.
* This ensures accounting, governance, and reward distribution are handled separately.

---

### 3. **Different configurations or parameters**

* Pools may vary in:

  * Fees
  * Collateralization ratios
  * Reward rates
  * Token wrappers (e.g., wrapped vs native token)
* Even though the underlying token is the same, the pool’s behavior and rules are different, so they are modeled separately.

---

### 4. **Protocol upgrades or versions**

* Sometimes old pools are deprecated but still exist on-chain, while new pools for the same token are created.
* Modeling each pool separately allows **historical tracking** and auditability.

---

### 5. **Cross-chain deployments**

* The same token might exist on multiple chains or L2 solutions.
* Each chain’s version of the token may have a separate pool (even if they represent the same “asset” logically).

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

> Multiple pools for the same token exist because **each pool represents a distinct smart contract, configuration, or context**, not just the token itself. Linking all pools to the same **asset** lets you see them as instances of the same underlying token while still tracking each pool separately.

If you want, I can make a **mini diagram showing Asset → multiple Pools → Transfers → Events**, which makes the relationship between one token and many pools crystal clear. Do you want me to do that?
